# Concentration
This game will test your Concentration!

Memorize the board of cards and try to match pairs as fast as you can and with as few flips as possible.

You can check how many moves you made and how many bad guesses anytime.

If you guess wrong  more than 10 times or time running out, you lose!

Good luck and have fun!
